# Contributing 

We love your input! We want to make contributing as easy and transparent as possible.

## Development Process
We use GitHub to sync code, track issues, feature requests, and accept pull requests.

## Pull Request Process
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/feature`)
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Guidelines
- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Make sure all tests pass
